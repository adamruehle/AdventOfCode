# AdventOfCode
 
Each year, Eric Wastl makes an advent calendar of coding problems that can only be solved by creating unique program. According to Eric, "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like." This repository contains my solutions to each 2-part question from the 2021 Advent of Code.
